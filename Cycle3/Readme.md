#This is Cycle 3 for Java S3 Lab.

1. Program to create a student class with name, roll no and marks of five subjects. Write functions to read and display the details.

Output:![](https://github.com/karthikvijay5227/JavaS3Lab/blob/main/Cycle3/Outputs/Student.png)

2. Program with functions included within the main() class to find factorial and sum of digits of the number

Output:![](https://github.com/karthikvijay5227/JavaS3Lab/blob/main/Cycle3/Outputs/Calc.png)

3. Create a class with functions to find the frequency of a given character in a string and to reverse a given string. The functions should be invoked
from the main().

Output:![](https://github.com/karthikvijay5227/JavaS3Lab/blob/main/Cycle3/Outputs/StringCalc.png)

4. Write a Java program to calculate the area of different shapes namely circle, rectangle, and triangle using the concept of method overloading.

Output:![](https://github.com/karthikvijay5227/JavaS3Lab/blob/main/Cycle3/Outputs/Mensuration.png)

5. Write a Java program to calculate the perimeter of different shapes namely circle and rectangle using the concept of constructor overloading.

Output:![](https://github.com/karthikvijay5227/JavaS3Lab/blob/main/Cycle3/Outputs/Perimeter.png)

6. Java program to concatenate two numbers and strings using method overloading concept.

Output:![](https://github.com/karthikvijay5227/JavaS3Lab/blob/main/Cycle3/Outputs/Concatenate.png)

7. Java program to create a class employee with details such as empno, name and phone number. Read details of at least 5employees and print.
